# octofit-tracker Application

## Overview
The octofit-tracker application is designed to help users track their fitness activities and progress. It provides a user-friendly interface for logging workouts, monitoring fitness goals, and analyzing performance over time.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into two main directories:

- **backend**: Contains the server-side code, including the Python virtual environment and dependencies.
- **frontend**: Intended for the client-side application, which will be developed to provide an interactive user experience.
